Folly: Facebook Open-source LibrarY
-----------------------------------

Folly is an open-source C++ library developed and used at Facebook.

Note to Facebook contributors:
* Code in folly may ONLY depend on other code from folly,
  external libraries from /home/engshare/externals and from
  fbcode/external (preferably only the latter, eventually all deps
  will be moved to external)
* Code in folly goes in namespace folly.
* Tests should go in tests directory.
* Please keep Makefile.am's up to date.  fbconfig should warn if
  it thinks something is missing.
* NO EXCEPTIONS. This will eventually be enforced.
* config.h is a generated file.  It is checked in so fbmake can run
  without needing to run autotools.  To regenerate it, run
  autoreconf
  ./configure
  You will probably also have to export the correct paths for your
  enviroment (such as CC or CXX_INCLUDES) since we aren't using
  the standard linux paths.

Dependencies
------------

- double-conversion (http://code.google.com/p/double-conversion/)

    By default, the build tooling for double-conversion does not build
    any libraries, which folly requires.  To build the necessary libraries
    copy folly/SConstruct.double-conversion to your double-conversion
    source directory before building:

      [double-conversion/] scons -f SConstruct.double-conversion

    Then set CPPFLAGS/LDFLAGS so that folly can find your double-conversion
    build:

      [folly/] LDFLAGS=-L<double-conversion>/ CPPFLAGS=-I<double-conversion>/src/
        configure ...

- googletest (Google C++ Testing Framework)

  Grab gtest 1.6.0 from:
  http://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.6.0.zip

  Unzip it inside of the test/ subdirectory.
